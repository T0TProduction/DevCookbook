# Creamy Open Sauce Gnocchi

> You will not want to fork any other gnocchi after trying these.

## Ingredients

- 500 g (or ~18 oz) gnocchi
- 200 ml (or ~1 cup) heavy cream
- a slice of gorgonzola (~200 g or 7 oz)
- a pinch of salt

## Directions

1. Start melting the gorgonzola in a pan on medium to high heat.
2. While waiting, put on water to boil.
3. When the gorgonzola is mostly melted, add the cream to the pan. Adjust heat to keep it bubbling.
4. When the water is boiling, salt it and add the gnocchi.
5. Let the sauce thicken up while waiting for the gnocchi to float to the top.
6. Take out the gnocchi and add them to the sauce.
7. If you're into it, add some salad as side dish. Fork and enjoy.
